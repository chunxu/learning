# # TensorFlow Basics
# 
# Remember to reference the video for full explanations, this is just a notebook for code reference.
# 
# You can import the library:


import tensorflow as tf


print(tf.__version__)


# ### Simple Constants
# 
# Let's show how to create a simple constant with Tensorflow, which TF stores as a tensor object:


hello = tf.constant('Hello World')


type(hello)

x = tf.constant(100)


type(x)


# ### Running Sessions
# 
# Now you can create a TensorFlow Session, which is a class for running TensorFlow operations.
# 
# A `Session` object encapsulates the environment in which `Operation`
# objects are executed, and `Tensor` objects are evaluated. For example:

sess = tf.Session()

sess.run(hello)

type(sess.run(hello))

sess.run(x)

type(sess.run(x))


# ## Operations
# 
# You can line up multiple Tensorflow operations in to be run during a session:


x = tf.constant(2)
y = tf.constant(3)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    print('Operations with Constants')
    print('Addition',sess.run(x+y))
    print('Subtraction',sess.run(x-y))
    print('Multiplication',sess.run(x*y))
    print('Division',sess.run(x/y))


# ### Placeholder
# 
# You may not always have the constants right away, and you may be waiting for a constant to appear after a cycle of operations. **tf.placeholder** is a tool for this. It inserts a placeholder for a tensor that will be always fed.
# 
# **Important**: This tensor will produce an error if evaluated. Its value must be fed using the `feed_dict` optional argument to `Session.run()`,
# `Tensor.eval()`, or `Operation.run()`. For example, for a placeholder of a matrix of floating point numbers:
# 
#     x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1024, 1024))
# 
# Here is an example for integer placeholders:

x = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
x
type(x)


# ### Defining Operations

add = tf.add(x,y)
sub = tf.subtract(x,y)
mul = tf.multiply(x,y)


# Running operations with variable input:


d = {x:20,y:30}

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print('Operations with Constants')
    print('Addition',sess.run(add,feed_dict=d))
    print('Subtraction',sess.run(sub,feed_dict=d))
    print('Multiplication',sess.run(mul,feed_dict=d))


# Now let's see an example of a more complex operation, using Matrix Multiplication. First we need to create the matrices:

import numpy as np
# Make sure to use floats here, int64 will cause an error.
a = np.array([[5.0,5.0]])
b = np.array([[2.0],[2.0]])


a
a.shape
b
b.shape
mat1 = tf.constant(a)


mat2 = tf.constant(b)


matrix_multi = tf.matmul(mat1,mat2)


# Now run the session to perform the Operation:

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(matrix_multi)
    print(result)
